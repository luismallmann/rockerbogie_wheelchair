# rockerbogie_wheelchair
 This project consists of a small scale model of a motorized wheelchair, capable of overcoming different types of obstacles and irregularities in the terrain. Its development was inspired by the Rocker Bogie suspension system created by NASA. For its construction, in addition to the available parts and selected materials, an Android smartphone is also required control movement.
